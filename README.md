# Transcribe

Transcribe is a starting project aiming to automatic transcript video/audio to text. 
The idea is not fully original, since a lot of other softwares on the market already offer the same possibility, although Transcribe is the only completly free and open-sourse i've seen so far.

Instalation:
1- The transcribe currently uses PyDub library, wich requires FFMPEG installed, wich official link is: https://www.ffmpeg.org/. Windows users can easily install by following these steps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z9rUl9r2oA.

2- You also need to install Python, in case you didn't yet. I recommend you to download on the official website (https://www.python.org/) the lattest stable version. However, here will be a Windows script available to automatic install python and all dependecies you need.
2.1 - In case you only want to try or use the program, without actually change, develop or test the code, there is an .exe file available on my drive, than you'll only need to run it. Notice it is important to download the whole directory, not only the .exe. Drive:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19tO-vY6_XBEZ7ns71YDlalxG20Le6Pdb?usp=sharing
